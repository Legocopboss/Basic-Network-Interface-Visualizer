# Basic-Network-Interface-Visualizer

This is a basic network interface visualizer I whipped up in a couple hours mostly because I got severely distracted. Long story but it led to me making this.

This program allows you to see your signal strengh as a percentage and your Transmit and Receive rates in Mbps.

## Install

git clone this
cd Basic-Network-Interface-Visualizer


## Run the Program

python3 main.py

Pretty self explanatory. Once you run the program you will be prompted to hit the "Start" button which will start the program officially. To toggle the Transmit and Receive rates view just hit the button. Pretty easy

Delay Slider changes how long it waits before each ping of your network on a scale of 0.5 - 15 seconds. Default value is 5 seconds.

**CAUTION: The lower you set the delay the laggier the program will become. It's common sense but I had to mention it**
